Prior to July, 2008 40 CFR 75, Appendix F assigned an equation constant - the Fc-Factor - of \"1800\" to be used for both bituminous and sub-bituminous coal.  The current regulations assign an Fc-Factor of \"1800\" for bituminous coal and \"1840\" for sub-bituminous coal.   Quindaro Unit Q2 burns sub-bituminous coal and, thus, the applicable updated Fc-Factor is 1840.  The Fc-Factor was changed to reflect the current requirements and this change was applied back to January 1, 2012.Bob Vollaro, at the EPA Clean Air Markets Emissions Monitoring Division, was notified of this discovery and of the planned changes to the NetDAHS system.  EPA determined that recalculation of post July 2008 emissions with the updated Fc-Factor and resubmission of the Acid Rain quarterly reports for the years 2008 through 2011 is not necessary because replacing the Fc-Factor for bituminous coal (1800) with the factor for sub-bituminous coal (1840) for those years would increase the reported annual NOx emission rates by only 2.2%, and would not result in any exceedances of the annual Part 76 NOx emission rate limits.","beginDate":"2012-01-01","endDate":"2012-03-31"},{"monitoringPlanComment":"Notification of Certification Event: For Quindaro Unit 2 (Q2) a like-kind replacement of CO2, NOx and SO2 analyzers occurred on 3/13/12 at 1000.
