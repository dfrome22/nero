Since these shelters have the same configuration, they were left in place and the labeling corrected to reflect the proper setup. Recently, the CT02 NOx analyzer was replaced due to drift problems. In this process in was noted that the serial numbers reported within ECMPS had not been corrected after the shelters were left in this switched configuration. During the 2015Q4 reporting process, these serial numbers were corrected within the monitoring plan.
